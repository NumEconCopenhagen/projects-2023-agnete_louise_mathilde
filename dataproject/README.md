# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Recipients of subsidy to private day-care and day-care of own children by region** and is about just that.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. DAGTIL4 (Statsitics Denmark)
2. BY2 (Statsitics Denmark)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``pip install pandas-datareader``
``pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst``
