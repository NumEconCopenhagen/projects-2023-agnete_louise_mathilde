    "The market \"price\" of cloth when trading will be in between 0.83 and 1.13. In this interval, both parties benefit from the trade as England gets a higher \"price\" than what it \"costs\" to produce it, and Portugal \"buy\" the cloth cheaper than what it would have cost them to produce it themselves. The market \"price\" for wine when trading will be in between 0.89 and 1.2 for the same reasons as with cloth - just the other way around. To summarize; the market \"prices\" in these intervals make sence for both countries because the \"prices\" are lower than their oppertunity cost of producing it themselves."
