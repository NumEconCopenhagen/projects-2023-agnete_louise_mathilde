This repository contains  
1. **Inaugural project**. Here we investigate how the elasticity of substitution and the relative efficiency of home production affect the ratio "Men work at home" / "Women work at home".

2. **Data project**. Here we investigate the development in the fraction/number of children in private daycare across municipalities from 2010 to 2021. 

3. **Model project**. Two countries have a simple production function with time as the only input and either wine or cloth as the output. One country has the absolut advantage, and both countries have a comparative advantage. We show the optimal trade level when their preferences are identical. And, in the further analysis we investigate what happens to consumption/production when we vary the preferences of one of the countries.
